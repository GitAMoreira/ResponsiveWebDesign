        <p id="intro">The Total War franchise covers several time periods and geographical areas, even going to a fantasy universe. Below are a few of the released titles with some contextual information. </p>
      
      <div id="tribute-info">
        <ul id="games-list">
          <li><b>2000 - Shogun Total War</b>
            <p class="context-info">The first Total War released, focusing in Feudal Japan, specifically the period known as <em>The Sengoku Jidai</em> - "The Warring States".  It differs mostly from the current ones in its campaign map and the consequential type of movement. The map is divided in provinces and each army can only move directly from one territory to an adjacent one, with the exception of ports that allow for bigger movements.</p>

              <li>Agent cutscenes for their actions</li>
              <li>Throne room and cutscenes with dialogue when visited by emissaries</li>

          <li class="game"><b>2002 - Medieval Total War</b>
            <p class="context-info">The second Total War game shares the same game engine and, therefore, the same kind of campaign map experience, but with the attention shifted to Medieval Europe with some North African and Middle Eastern territory. One of the main focuses goes to the Crusades and Jihads for Catholic and Muslim factions respectively.</p>
            <ul class="features-list">Some notable features:
