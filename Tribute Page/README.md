## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to make a tribute page. 

## Process
Following the mindset of the previous project, I chose the Total War franchise as my focus. I initially thought of making it longer, but since this is mostly to show off the knowledge and skills acquired, in conclusion, I felt it would mostly be a time waste, since I was just going to add more entries. I have 2 items in my list which I think was enough.

I felt that this certification project wasn't as connected to the previous lesson-projects as the one before was, because most of the CSS shown on those lessons weren't required. Actually, the only "visual" requirements were relative to the image and nothing else, unless I'm misremembering. If the page doesn't seem that visually appealing is because there were no requirements about it and, even though I could spend some time polishing it (and I did for a while), I'd rather move on with the course and learn more functional skills. 

## Conclusions
One of the positives notes about this project is that I'm realizing that I prefer the more functional aspects of software development than the cosmetic ones. Even though I would like to be creative enough to make the page look the way I imagine it, the problem is that I'm spending way more time searching and understanding the functions needed to make the page look better than I should. That is why I chose to finish this project and move on. 

Honestly, I'm not that happy with the end result, mostly because I didn't use a lot of the functions learned, but they weren't even needed. Between this one and the previous project, I prefer the first one. I don't think it visually ugly, but I feel like it lacks something.

Below are the screenshots of the page - I added a disclaimer at the end of the page that notes that I use the image for demonstration and educational (since this is a learning course) purposes only.
