        <p>Steam is an online store for the digital distribution of videogames that is owned and ran by Valve Corporation. It works as a library of said videogames for each user. Steam also includes social network features dedicated to gaming in general with forums and community pages dedicated to each game. Other features exist, such as collecting trading cards in order to craft badges to show off on the user's profile, for example.</p>

        <header>Tips</header>
        <p>Below are some examples that might help navigate Steam, along with a few tricks to use on Valve games.</p>
        <p class="tips">While on any tab on Steam, press <code>Ctrl + f</code> and type in whatever keyword you want to find it on your current page. This is particularly useful if you have a lot of items on your wishlist and want to find some of a particular franchise for example.</p>
        <p class="tips">Press <code>Shift + Tab</code> during a game to open the Steam Overlay, which lets you chat or browse the web without exiting the game.</p>
        <p class="tips">You can add custom launch options to games by right-clicking the title in your Library, selecting <code>Properties</code>, and adding something like <code>-fullscreen</code> in the launch options box.</p>
        <p class="tips">Adding <code>-dx11</code> to a game's launch options can help resolve graphical issues or force a specific mode.</p>
        <p class="tips">To enable the console in Source engine games, go to settings and enable the developer console, then press (usually) <code>\</code> to open it. You can use commands like <code>sv_cheats 1</code> or <code>noclip</code> for testing.</p>
